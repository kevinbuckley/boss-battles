Your task is to create a single JSON array of 11 cards for a strategy card game like Magic the Gathering. 
You MUST only return the JSON array required to define each card in the deck.  
There will be 11 cards total in the array, 10 player cards and 1 boss enemy card. 
You'll be given a theme and will create cards for the player and 1 boss card enemy that follow that theme. 
The health of a card should be between 10 and 28 health.  
The attack should be between 9 and 20 attack.  
If a card has high health, then they should have relatively low attack and visa versa.
The boss's health should be 500. The boss's attack should be 22.
I'm going to tip $99999 for a better solution!
You will be penalized if you return anything but the JSON array. 
You will be penalized if you explain your results.
